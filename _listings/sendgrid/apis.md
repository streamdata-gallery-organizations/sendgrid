    This endpoint will return information for each group ID that you include in your request. To add a group ID to your request, simply append `&id=` followed by the group ID.

    Suppressions are a list of email addresses that will not receive content sent under a given [group](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html).

    Suppression groups, or [unsubscribe groups](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html), allow you to label a category of content that you regularly send. This gives your recipients the ability to opt out of a specific set of your email. For example, you might define a group for your transactional email, and one for your marketing email so that your users can continue recieving your transactional email witout having to receive your marketing content.

    Suppressions are recipient email addresses that are added to [unsubscribe groups](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html). Once a recipient's address is on the suppressions list for an unsubscribe group, they will not receive any emails that are tagged with that unsubscribe group.

    * If field_name is a 'reserved' date field, such as created_at or updated_at, the system will internally convert
    your epoch time to a date range encompassing the entire day. For example, an epoch time of 1422835600 converts to
    Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:06:40 GMT, but internally the system will search from Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:00:00 GMT through
    Mon, 02 Feb 2015 23:59:59 GMT.

    [Blocks](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Glossary/blocks.html) happen when your message was rejected for a reason related to the message, not the recipient address. This can happen when your mail server IP address has been added to a blacklist or blocked by an ISP, or if the message content is flagged by a filter on the receiving server.
