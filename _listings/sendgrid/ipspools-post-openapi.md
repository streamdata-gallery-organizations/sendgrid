  title: SendGrid Add Ips Pools
  description: |-
    **This endpoint allows you to create an IP pool.**

    **Each user can create up to 10 different IP pools.**

    IP Pools allow you to group your dedicated SendGrid IP addresses together. For example, you could create separate pools for your transactional and marketing email. When sending marketing emails, specify that you want to use the marketing IP pool. This allows you to maintain separate reputations for your different email traffic.

    IP pools can only be used with whitelabeled IP addresses.

    If an IP pool is NOT specified for an email, it will use any IP available, including ones in pools.

        Suppressions are a list of email addresses that will not receive content sent under a given [group](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html).

        Suppression groups, or [unsubscribe groups](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html), allow you to label a category of content that you regularly send. This gives your recipients the ability to opt out of a specific set of your email. For example, you might define a group for your transactional email, and one for your marketing email so that your users can continue recieving your transactional email witout having to receive your marketing content.

        field_name:

        * is a variable that is substituted for your actual custom field name from your recipient.
        * Text fields must be url-encoded. Date fields are searchable only by unix timestamp (e.g. 2/2/2015 becomes 1422835200)
        * If field_name is a 'reserved' date field, such as created_at or updated_at, the system will internally convert
        your epoch time to a date range encompassing the entire day. For example, an epoch time of 1422835600 converts to
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:06:40 GMT, but internally the system will search from Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:00:00 GMT through
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 23:59:59 GMT.

        **This endpoint allows you to retreive all of your IP pools.**

        IP Pools allow you to group your dedicated SendGrid IP addresses together. For example, you could create separate pools for your transactional and marketing email. When sending marketing emails, specify that you want to use the marketing IP pool. This allows you to maintain separate reputations for your different email traffic.

        IP pools can only be used with whitelabeled IP addresses.

        If an IP pool is NOT specified for an email, it will use any IP available, including ones in pools.
