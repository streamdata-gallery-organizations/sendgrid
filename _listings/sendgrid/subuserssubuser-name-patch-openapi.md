        field_name:

        * is a variable that is substituted for your actual custom field name from your recipient.
        * Text fields must be url-encoded. Date fields are searchable only by unix timestamp (e.g. 2/2/2015 becomes 1422835200)
        * If field_name is a 'reserved' date field, such as created_at or updated_at, the system will internally convert
        your epoch time to a date range encompassing the entire day. For example, an epoch time of 1422835600 converts to
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:06:40 GMT, but internally the system will search from Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:00:00 GMT through
        Mon, 02 Feb 2015 23:59:59 GMT.
